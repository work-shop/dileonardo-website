					As homage to the landscape and architecture, the interior is largely inspired by the idea of framing the extraordinary views of Yanqi Lake; whether it is capturing the view of the exterior landscape or framing areas within by enclosing a space or setting a vignette of the interior d√©cor. The design creates elements of intrigue within the overall space of the hotel by experimenting with the juxtaposition of solids and voids and infusing reoccurring geometric forms into unexpected spaces, design elements or features.
